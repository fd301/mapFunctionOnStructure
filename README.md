# mapFunctionOnStructure
Python package for multi-modal connectivity analysis

Sample code in python for model identification is provided. Model identification is the process we use to identify structural connections related to functional connections assigned with a probability. The precision matrix is estimated based on the Ledoit-Wolf estimator. This is a regularised version of estimating covariance matrices compared to simple correlation coefficient. (Main script: fun2strucInt_v01.py)

I also provide the scripts used to implement the bootstrap procedure in our IEEE TMI publication.
The Gaussian graphical model based on the Iterative Proportional Scaling algorithm is written by Dr. Gael Varoquaux. (Main script: fun2strucBootstrap_v01.py)
